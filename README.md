# Facial_Expression_Detection

### Description

Convolutional neural network (CNN) is the most popular way of analyzing images. Using the concepts of CNN, we can detect the **Facial Emotion Expressions**.  
We achieved this by training our CNN model with large dataset. We have used the dataset named *fer2013* which is an open-source data set that was made publicaly available for a Kaggle competition. It contains 48 X 48-pixel grayscale images of the face. There are seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral) present in the data. The CSV file contains two columns that are emotion that contains numeric code from 0-6 and a pixel column that includes a string surrounded in quotes for each image.
